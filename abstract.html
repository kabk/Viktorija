        <h1>Abstract</h1>
		<p>Kandinsky questioned presence of interaction between work of art

and the viewer already in the beginning of the twentieth century. 

Therefore, he analyses the point and the line and their relation with 

the plane. The goal of Kandinsky’s theory was “to find the living 

[and] to make its pulsation perceptible”. He tries to engage the sight, 

emotion and mind of the public. Kandinsky explores possibilities of 

creating a dialog between the viewer and the artwork by using the 

point, the line and the plane. 
</p>

<p>Arjen Mulder writes that Kandinsky figured out how the line operates 

in the two dimensional force field and interactive art continues 

its research. Moreover, Arjen Mulder elaborates that Kandinsky 

provided us a model for media art. Therefore the question arises:</p>

<p><i>how can today’s media art be seen in the light of Kandinsky’s theory

of interactivity?</i>.</p>


<p>To answer this question it was important to describe the 

concept of interactivity and see how it was corresponding with 

Kandinsky’s attempt “to find a living [and] make its pulsation 

perceptible”. Moreover, to see how media art can be seen in the 

light of Kandinsky’s theory of the point, the line and the plane it was 

important to describe the fundamental points of his ideas. Finally, 

in the book Point and Line to Plane Kandinsky gives examples of 

the point and the line in other forms of art than the painting. In this 

thesis, these examples were compared with today’s media art projects 

that explore the same forms of art. </p>

<p>	The results of research led to these conclusions: firstly, creating an 

interactive art work means making perceptual signs that allows a 

range of responses. Perceptual signs let to interpret meaning, to 

generate attention, and to begin investigation of the world. When 

the mind is triggered by an interactive work and it becomes active, 

communication turns into interaction. Secondly, visual perception 

plays an important role in finding and understanding “perceptual 

signs”. Susanne K. Langer explains that vision is dynamic and 

therefore we see movement that follows through design. Finally, the 

comparison between Kandinsky’s examples and media art project.</p>
