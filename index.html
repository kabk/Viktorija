	Research: How Kandinsky's theory of interactivity is applied in today's media art?
</p>
<p>
	Abstract
</p>
<p>
	A combination of mind philosophy and art theory development in twentieth century resulted in a new understanding of visual perception and interaction with
	the viewer, provoking significant changes in art.
</p>
<p>
	In the book "From image to interaction", Arjen Mulder wrote that "we are in Neo - Plasticism 2.0." He claims that painting was the medium all the other
	twentieth-century media were derived from, as remediations of specific painters' methods of creating images. Therefore, Mulder states that Kandinsky
	provided us a model for video art and its derivative, media art.
</p>
<p>
	Kandinsky questioned presence of interaction between work of art and the viewer already in the beginning of the twentieth century. Therefore, he analyses
	point and line and their relation with the plane.
</p>
<p>
	To understand Kandinsky's theory on interactivity and its relation to media art, it is important to elaborate on philosophical explorations of human
	perception. This reveals the nature of how we see and how interactivity is perceived. The goal of Kandinsky's theory was "to find the living, to make its
	pulsation perceptible" that allows creating relationship (interaction) between views and art work. Are these "living" forms visible in today's media art?
