	<ins cite="mailto:Viktorija" datetime="2014-11-23T23:22"> </ins>
</h3>
<p>
	Susanne Katherina Langer was an American philosopher, who wrote about mind and art. Her philosophy explored the continuous process of meaning - making in
	the human mind through seeing one thing in terms of another. She wrote about the process of abstraction, which goes on all the time in the human mind.
	Susanne Langer was one of the first philosophers who explored the concept of virtual. Her publications offered the reader a systematic, comprehensive
	theory of art applied to painting, sculpture, architecture, literature, music, the dance and film.
</p>
<p>
	What does it mean; the continuous process of meaning making in the human mind through seeing one thing in terms of another? To begin with we have to
	realise that such a thing as stable form does not exist. The idea that there is such a thing as fixed form is only the assumption. That would suggest the
idea that vision is not dynamic - that it is passive, simply registering something that is just there. But Susanne Langer reminds us that we see thing	<ins cite="mailto:Viktorija" datetime="2014-11-23T22:28">s</ins> we do not actually see. We all know it, but we tend to brush it off calling it an
	illusion. That raises the question about the nature of our perception and that vision is actually dynamic itself.
</p>
<p>
	Susanne K. Langer's example of spiralling, vegetal motifs we see in a lot of traditional decorative art states obvious: we do not see spirals we see
spiralling. We see a movement that flows through the design.	<a href="file:///D:/thesis_research/i%20write/thesis_clean_for_github.docx#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Forms are not moving but we also cannot
	ignore the fact that we see a movement when we look at them. Can we call it an illusion?
</p>
<p>
In the interview with Brian Massumi<ins cite="mailto:Viktorija" datetime="2014-11-23T22:29">,</ins> who refers to Langer's philosophy	<ins cite="mailto:Viktorija" datetime="2014-11-23T22:30">,</ins> this seeing of movement in a motif is explained as abstraction: "Instead of calling it an
	illusion - this movement that we cannot actually see but cannot not see either - why not just call it abstract?" Massumi elaborates further that reality
	and abstraction supplement each other. He explains that we see movement because of design being there and if we saw an actual design we would not be seeing
	what it is we are seeing - a motif.
</p>
<p>
	Seeing is something that we do, it is a kind of action. We do not just register the surface of what we see, we see a potential of our bodies for example to
	walk around. Seeing an object is seeing through its qualities. If it is a 3D form we see volume, we see the other side without actually seeing it. Brian
	Massumi explains this quality of seeing as follows: "With every sight we see imperceptible qualities, we abstractly see potential, we implicitly see a life
	dynamic, we virtually live relation&#8230;&lt;&gt; It's an event. An object's appearance is an event, full of all sorts of virtual movement. It's real
	movement, because something has happened: the body has been capacitated. It's been relationally activated. It is alive in the world, poised for what may
	come. This is also "seen" - there's a sense of aliveness that accompanies every perception. We don't just look, we sense ourselves alive. Every perception
	comes with its own "vitality affect" (to use a term of Daniel Stern's)." This is the aliveness what Susanne Langer explored. The philosopher wrote that
	paintings create virtual spaces: the space in a painting is not the real (flat) space of the canvas, but the virtual or imagined space the viewer sees.
</p>
<p>
	Langer's philosophy explains how design can give a movement to a form, how abstraction gives interactivity and how qualities of our perception bring the
	viewer to a virtual space. These ideas gave broader tools to artist to create interactivity.
</p>
<h3>
	<a name="_Toc405541144">Gestalt theory</a>
</h3>
<p>
	Another important twentieth century theory that deals with perception is Gestalt principle of grouping. Term "Gestalt" translated from German language
means "whole" or "form". The central principle of Gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a "global whole" with self-organizing tendencies	<a href="file:///D:/thesis_research/i%20write/thesis_clean_for_github.docx#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. This 'gestalt' or 'whole form' defines
principles of perception-mental laws that determine the way objects are perceived. It is based on the here and now, and in the way things are seen.	<a href="file:///D:/thesis_research/i%20write/thesis_clean_for_github.docx#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>
</p>
<p>
	In order to interpret what we receive through our senses, Gestalt theory explains that we attempt to organise this information into certain groups. Humans
	naturally perceive objects as organised patterns and objects Gestalt psychologists argued that these principles exist because the mind has an innate
disposition to perceive patterns in the stimulus based on certain rules	<a href="file:///D:/thesis_research/i%20write/thesis_clean_for_github.docx#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>. The Gestalt principles of grouping
	include four types: similarity, proximity, continuity, and closure.
</p>
<p>
	The principle of similarity states that, all else being equal, perception lends itself to seeing stimuli that physically resemble each other as part of the
	same object, and stimuli that are different as part of a different object. This allows for people to distinguish between adjacent and overlapping objects
	based on their visual texture and resemblance. Other stimuli that have different features are generally not perceived as part of the object. Our brain uses
	similarity to distinguish between objects that may lay adjacent to or overlap with each other based upon their visual texture.
</p>
<p>
	The principle of proximity states that, all else being equal, perception tends to group stimuli that are close together as part of the same object, and
	stimuli that are far apart as two separate objects. This allows for the grouping together of elements into larger sets, and reduces the need to process a
	larger number of smaller stimuli. For this reason, people tend to see clusters of dots on a page instead of a large number of individual dots. The brain
groups together the elements instead of processing a large number of smaller stimuli, allowing us to understand and conceptualize information more quickly.	<a href="file:///D:/thesis_research/i%20write/thesis_clean_for_github.docx#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>
</p>
<p>
	The principle of closure refers to the mind's tendency to see complete figures or a form even if a picture is incomplete, partially hidden by other
	objects, or if part of the information needed to make a complete picture in our minds is missing. For example, if part of a shape's border is missing
	people still tend to see the shape as completely enclosed by the border and ignore the gaps. This reaction stems from our mind's natural tendency to
	recognize patterns that are familiar to us and thus fill in any information that may be missing.
</p>
<p>
	When there is an intersection between two or more objects, people tend to perceive each object as a single uninterrupted object. This allows
	differentiation of stimuli even when they come in visual overlap. We have a tendency to group and organize lines or curves that follow an established
direction over those defined by sharp and abrupt changes in direction...	<a href="file:///D:/thesis_research/i%20write/thesis_clean_for_github.docx#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a>
</p>
<p>
	Gestalt theory explained main principles of our vision and these theories are broadly used in graphic design, interactive media design, and art.
	Understanding of how we see things, how we tend to recognize patterns and group objects gave the ability to create engaging design/artwork.
</p>
<p>
	Susanne K. Langer's philosophy and Gestalt theory gave us a new understanding of visual perception. It resulted in a capability to show life dynamics with
	and through actual form and take viewer to virtual space.

<h2>
	<a name="_Toc405541146">About Kandinsky and his theory</a>
</h2>
<p>
	Wassily Kandinsky was one of the pioneers of abstract modern art. He explored the interrelation between colour, form, line direction and intensity of the
	point to create an aesthetic experience. In this way artist engaged the sight, sound and emotions of the public. The painter believed that total
	abstraction offered the possibility for profound and transcendental expression. Hilla Rebay wrote: "As his last paintings prove, with intense
	concentration, Kandinsky increasingly refined the precision of balance in the given space of the painting, as the innermost powerful essence of its
	rhythmic tension. &lt;&#8230;&gt; . He found that a non-objective painting's rhythmic life, expressing creative invention, can be profound if done by a
	visionary master. It can also have a strong ordering influence on the observer."
</p>
<p>
	On the contrary<ins cite="mailto:Viktorija" datetime="2014-11-23T22:39">,</ins> copying from nature only interferes with the experiencing what painting can
	offer. It only provides stillness and transmits one message that does not have any influence on the viewer's mind. Therefore, Kandinsky wrote: "Contrary to
	the static form-ideal of painting which prevailed in the past millennium, where the subjective object was immediately perceived as a whole and graphically
	recorded by the intellect, always directed objectively earthward, the moving form-ideal of today sets into motion the eye in any desired direction of the
	rhythmic non-objective creation."
</p>
<p>
	Kandinsky was the first who proclaimed his principles of painting in a book point and line to plane. With scientific precision painter describes
	characteristics (that he calls sound) of a point, line and their interaction within a plane. He explained how to evoke rhythmic life and engage viewer's
	mind with the composition of primary forms, line and point.
</p>
<p>
	Kandinsky's art and ideas inspired many generations of artists: his students, later such painters as Jackson Pollack, Philip Guston, Mark Rothko and many
	other twentieth century artist. Kandinsky's ideas are relevant today as well, thought from the painting they shifted to media art. For example such artist/
	engineer as Golan Levin in his investigation in interface used Kandinsky's theories to "engage the unconscious mind directly". In work of many other
	artists Kandinsky's ideas are still visible and perhaps functioning even better than in a painting.
</p>
<h3>
	<a name="_Toc405541147">Kandinsky and the future</a>
</h3>
<p>
	Kandinsky refers to the future technological development in his theory point and line to plane. As painter tries to express his technique in numeric
	expression he discovers limited possibilities of measurement. Therefore he writes in his theory: "We today lack the possibilities of measurement which some
	day, sooner or later, will be found beyond the Utopian. From this moment on, it will be possible to give every composition its numerical expression, even
	though this may at first perhaps hold true only of its "basic plan" and its larger complexes." Further, the painter elaborates that only when numeric
	expression is conceivable, the exact theory of composition can be realized. The beginning of numeric expression lacks complexity that will be possible in
	the future.
</p>
<p>
	The future that we are in now brings these possibilities that Kandinsky was writing about, he was standing at the beginning of numeric expression. Where do
	we stand now? Today, media artist think in code or use software that is based on a code. There are many types of code. In this context it is important to
	elaborate on a code that represents series of instructions. This type of code is often called algorithm, procedure, or program - defines a specific
processes with enough detail to allow the instructions to be followed.	<a href="file:///D:/thesis_research/i%20write/thesis_clean_for_github.docx#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a>
</p>
<p>
Software is a tool for our mind. The software's resources and techniques at our disposal allow us to access and process enormous quantities of information.	<a href="file:///D:/thesis_research/i%20write/thesis_clean_for_github.docx#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a> Software is a tool to extend our
	intellect. It gives us possibilities that Kandinsky was referring to.
</p>
<p>
	In the 1940s, code was used to assist work in the fields of science and engineering. In the 1980s personal computers were introduced to the market,
	allowing programming to reach a wider audience. Therefore, many artists began to experiment with a given "tool". The influence of code is not limited to
	the screen and projected image.<a href="file:///D:/thesis_research/i%20write/thesis_clean_for_github.docx#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a> It is
	also felt in physical space.<a href="file:///D:/thesis_research/i%20write/thesis_clean_for_github.docx#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a> It is
used to control elements of products architecture, and installations.	<a href="file:///D:/thesis_research/i%20write/thesis_clean_for_github.docx#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a>
</p>
<p>
	Drawing with the computer is based on the same elements as Kandinsky referred to in his theory. Point and line can be created by using a coordinate system,
	giving a numeric value. In 1963, Ivan Sutherland introduced graphic user interface with his sketchpad. Sketchpad was much more than an analogue of paper
	and pen.<a href="file:///D:/thesis_research/i%20write/thesis_clean_for_github.docx#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a> The software allows a
	designer to create lines, draw polygons, circles, arc etc., move, duplicate, rotate them to create new compositions. The user was able to instruct the
	computer to interpret movements of the pen; therefore there was no need to describe elements in numeric terms every time. Computer aided design systems
	allowed designers to draw using mathematical lines and curves that had a big influence on productivity, speed and efficiency.
</p>
<p>
	With the increasing capacities and computer being able to interpret given algorithms we reached the future that Kandinsky was writing about. Now we are
	able to create endless compositions and express "rhythmic life".

<h3>
	<a name="_Toc405541149">Concept of the point</a>
</h3>
<p>
The point preserves its fundamental geometrical properties - invisibility and position	<a href="file:///D:/thesis_research/i%20write/thesis_clean_for_github.docx#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a>, therefore it can be defined as an
	incorporeal thing. To Kandinsky, a geometric point considered in terms of substance is equal to zero. But what form point embodies in a painting /graphic
	art?
</p>
<p>
	First of all, the point in painting/graphic art is a result of a collision with the tool and material plane. Kandinsky defines a point as the smallest,
	indivisible or the briefest elementary form, the proto - element of painting and especially of the "graphic." The term smallest in his theory is relative.
	The painter raises the question where is the boundary between point and plane. The point can grow and occupy all area; the point appears as a plane. The
	size of a point can be defined by other forms (example below). &#173;
</p>
<p align="center">
	<img width="275" height="212" src="file:///C:/Users/VIKTOR~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.jpg"/>
	Kandinsky
</p>
<pre>Secondly, Kandinsky talks about the external form of the graphic point. He writes that abstractly or imaginatively, the point is thought of as ideally small, ideally round. In reality, it is an ideally small circle. Nevertheless, just as in the case of its size, its limits are equally relative. In its material form, the point can assume an unlimited number of shapes: it can become jagged, it can move in the direction of other geometric forms, and finally develop into entirely free shapes (example below).</pre>
<pre><img width="265" height="187" src="file:///C:/Users/VIKTOR~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.jpg"/> Kandinsky</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>Thirdly, Kandinsky emphasizes the importance of the texture of an element. The texture affects the manner it is visually combined with other elements and with its graphic context. Kandinsky writes that texture possibilities should be given even in the limited field of the point.  Despite that the point is the smallest element it can display different sound depending on how it was created (examples bellow).</pre>
<pre><img width="228" height="300" src="file:///C:/Users/VIKTOR~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image006.jpg"/> <img width="317" height="300" src="file:///C:/Users/VIKTOR~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image008.jpg"/></pre>
<strong>

</strong>
<p>
	<strong></strong>
</p>
<h3>
	<a name="_Toc405541150">Time in the point</a>
</h3>
<pre><strong></strong></pre>
<pre>The element of time in the point is almost completely eliminated due to lack of mobility on and of the surface. The element of time in special cases of composition makes the point inevitable. Its use here corresponds to the sharp blow on a kettledrum or a triangle in music, or to the short tap of the woodpecker in nature. </pre>
<h3>
	<a name="_Toc405541151">Tension in the point</a>
</h3>
<p>
	The graphic point has an inner tension. Kandinsky writes that the tension within the point constitutes the element. Each individual graphic or pictorial
	form is an element. Materializing that element forces tensions which are alive within it.
</p>
<pre>Furthermore, Kandinsky elaborates on the energy that graphic element has inside. He claims that if these tensions were to disappear or to expire, the work, which is alive at that very instant, would die. On the other hand, every accidental grouping of several forms could be called a work of art. The content of a work of art finds its expression in the composition: that is, in the sum of the tensions inwardly organized for the work.</pre>
<pre>To conclude, the energy that is in the point also develops to the outside. This energy hurls itself upon the point which is digging its way into the surface, tears it out and pushes it about the surface in one direction or another. The concentric tension of the point is thereby immediately destroyed and, as a result, it perishes and a new being arises out of it which leads a new, independent life in accordance with its own laws. This is the Line.</pre>

</p>
<h3>
	<a name="_Toc405541152">Point in media art compared with Kandinsky's examples</a>
</h3>
<p>
	Kandinsky writes that point appears in other art expressions. Writing about point he gives example of a dance performance. First of all, he writes about
	classical ballet: "The rapid running on the toes leaves behind on the floor a trace of points. The ballet dancer leaps to a point above, clearly aiming at
	it with his head and, in landing, again contacts a point on the floor." Secondly, he compares classical ballet with modern dance. He examines "modern" leap
	by giving a schematic drawing or a dancer's leap. (Image below)
</p>
<p>
	Kandinsky writes: "the "modern" leap frequently forms a five-pointed plane with its five extremities - head, two feet and two hands, whereby the ten
	fingers form ten smaller points. Furthermore, the brief states of rigid immobility can be looked upon as points. Thus we have active and passive point
	formations which bear a relationship to the musical form of the point."

<p>
	Today's media artist attempts to visualise dance performance using what Kandinsky called the smallest form - the point. United Visual Artists in
	collaboration with contemporary UK dance group Mimbre create an eight minute live abstract performance out of points. UVA uses 3D cameras to capture the
	movement of the dancers on stage. This information is translated in real time to abstract white forms made out of points on a large - scale backdrop. In
	this way simultaneous performance is created.

	Kandinsky writes that "points can be produced in music with all sorts of instruments - especially the percussion instruments. The piano, however, enables
	the creation of finished compositions exclusively by means of the combination and the sequence of tonal points." Therefore, the painter gives examples of a
	translation of music pieces into points.

	In this project is visible another property of point that Kandinsky refers to - the point's ability to give birth to the line.
</p>
<p>
	Another project where Kandinsky's idea of sound represented with point is visible is Messa di Voce. Though this project does not deal with sound made by
	instrument it reflect the idea of point as an agent of sound. Golan Levin's software augments the speech, shouts and songs with real time interactive
	visualizations.
</p>
<p>
	The project touches on theme of abstract communication. Custom software transforms every vocal nuance into correspondingly complex, subtly differentiated
	and highly expressive graphics. Messa di Voce lies at an intersection of human and technological performance extremes, melding the unpredictable
	spontaneity and extended vocal techniques of human improvisers with the latest in computer vision and speech analysis technologies. Utterly wordless, yet
	profoundly verbal, Messa di Voce is designed to provoke questions about the meaning and effects of speech sounds, speech acts, and the immersive
	environment of language.<a href="file:///D:/thesis_research/i%20write/thesis_clean_for_github.docx#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="">[17]</a>

	Kandinsky's ideas that dance and sound can be represented with point are visible in today's media art. Here point is represented in real time visualizing
	sound and dance performance. On one hand, some characteristics of the point are visible instantly, on the other the texture of the point that was describe
	earlier is not applicable anymore. Point's characteristics depend on the process of its creation, and media artists use different tools to create the
	point.

</p>
<h3>
	<a name="_Toc405541154">Concept of the line</a>
</h3>
<p>
	Geometrical line is an invisible thing. Kandinsky sees the line as a derivative element from moving point. Line can be considered as the track of the
	moving point that signifies the visual transition from static to the dynamic. The characteristic visual property of the line becomes an ability to evoke
	motion. The line is the antithesis to the static point, as motion is antithesis to position. Our eyes follow the line as they stop at a point. Kandinsky
	categorises lines into straight, angular, curved.<ins cite="mailto:Viktorija" datetime="2014-11-23T23:28"></ins>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Straight line </strong>
</p>
<pre>Kandinsky describes generative cause of a line as action of one external force to a point. This line has a length of infinity.  Therefore its tension represents the most concise form of the potentiality for endless movement. Typical straight lines can be horizontal vertical or diagonal. Kandinsky sees the horizontal line as a flat supportive base while the vertical line is a complete contrast, it has height. Diagonal line derives from both of them. According to Kandinsky lines can be characterized by the centre into centric and accentric. Different arrangements of lines can be used in painting, architecture etc. where object needs to be organized in relation to particular centre. Different arrangements of lines lead to visual effect of pictorial depth.</pre>
<p>
	<strong>Angular line </strong>
</p>
<p>
	Kandinsky recognises angular lines as a more complex movement of a point influenced by two external forces. Moreover an angular line is considered as one
	line. When the moving point changes its straight course this action gives a notion of external force. Kandinsky describes how a given context interacts
	with the straight line and changes its form. An angular line is created by alternate action of two forces. A curved line is created by simultaneous action
	of two forces.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Curved line</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Kandinsky wrote that curved line is generated from simultaneous action of two forces on the point where the one force acts steadily and continually and
	exceed the other. This type of line tends to close itself. The simple curved line and the simple straight line have different characters. The straight line
expresses the infinity, en endless movement. On the contrary, curved line has an elastic character. Therefore	<ins cite="mailto:Viktorija" datetime="2014-11-23T23:14">,</ins> these two types of lines constitute the primary contrasting pair of lines. An angular line
	has a straight segments and a curved line lacks this quality.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Complex lines</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Kandinsky attempts to express the constructive power the parallel principle and the principle of contrast. The visual outcome is more complex and gives a
	notion of different rhythms. In complex combinations individual characteristics of lines become more obvious. Line has another characteristic; it tends to
	close itself and form in more solid structure the shape.

	Kandinsky
</p>
<h3>
	<a name="_Toc405541155">Texture</a>
</h3>
<pre>Kandinsky treats the edges of the line as two independent lines that are not necessarily continuously parallel or straight.  Therefore the outer lines can be considered as having a shape. They can be smooth, jagged, rounded line etc. All of these characteristics can be used in the three types of lines - straight, angular and curved - and each of the two sides can have a special treatment.</pre>
<pre>The weight of a line is also significant to Kandinsky's theory. He names it emphasis. This linear accentuation can be gradual or spontaneous, increased or decreased in strength. The use of emphasis enables the line to attain the shape necessary at the moment.  </pre>
<h3>
	<a name="_Toc405541156">Time</a>
</h3>
<p>
	The element of time in the line is much greater than in the case of the point. The length of the line is a concept of time. On the other hand, the time
	required to follow the straight line is different from that required for a curved one, even though the length is the same. The more animated the curved
	line becomes; the longer is the span of time it represents. On the other hand, the possibilities of using line as a time element are various.
</p>
<h3>
	<a name="_Toc405541157">Tension</a>
</h3>
<pre>Kandinsky writes that the point is rest and the line is inwardly animated tension created by movement. The two elements developed their language which cannot be explained with words.  The exclusion of "trimmings," which hush and obscure the inner sound of this message, lends the greatest brevity and precision to pictorial expressions. The pure form caries more tension and is able to dispose the living content.   </pre>
<pre>The line is the clearest and simplest case of creative process. Creative process in this case is when the action of the force on the given material brings life into the material (e.g. stoke of the pencil on a paper), which expresses itself in the tensions. The tensions permit the nature of the element to be expressed. An element is the objective result of the action of the force on the material. </pre>
<pre>Kandinsky elaborated on tensions of different lines as well. The straight line has two distinct primitive tensions which play an unimportant role in case of the curved line. Tension in straight lines is minimal as straight lines are silent<a href="file:///D:/thesis_research/i%20write/thesis_clean_for_github.docx#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">[18]</a> lines. Silence represents stillness. In a curved line tension resides in the ark.</pre>
<h2>
	<a name="_Toc405541158">Line in media art compared with Kandinsky's examples</a>
</h2>
<p>
	As with the point Kandinsky emphasis that line can be used in other forms of art not only in a painting. He writes that a more or less precise translation
	of line's characteristics can be found in other means of arts.
</p>

	Kandinsky
</p>
<p>
	Kandinsky writes that most music instruments are of a linear character. He gives an example of organ and piano. Organ according to Kandinsky is "line"
	instrument and piano a "point" instrument. As shown in the example above Kandinsky attempts to translate music in line and point. He further elaborates
	that in music the line supplies the greatest means of expression. Kandinsky writes that line manifest itself here in time and space just as it does in
	painting. Moreover he comments on graphical music representation that is common to use. Kandinsky talks about musical notation and he writes that it is
	nothing other than various combinations of point and line. He elaborates further that only one way to arrive at graphic expression is analytic separation
	into fundamental elements.
</p>
<p>
	This separation is visible in "Narrative 2.0" created by Matthias Dittrich. Code allows people to experience music in a visual way. Therefor the
	frequencies of a music piece are analysed frame by frame. The frequencies are laid out fan like, symbolizing the growth of music building up to the main
	theme. The increase the emphasize of significant patterns of the music a highlight was added. The goal of the visualization was not to create a
	deconstructive code. The established system should rather enable the music to become a visual artist by itself, creating an aesthetic response to its
	music.<a href="file:///D:/thesis_research/i%20write/thesis_clean_for_github.docx#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">[19]</a>

	Kandinsky writes that the role and significance of the line is also seen in architecture and engineering. A structure in space is at the same time a linear
	construction. Kandinsky gives an example of the Eiffel Tower. It was the most significant early attempt to create an especially high building out of lines.
	The line replaces the plane in the Eiffel Tower. (write something more)

	Drawing on the power of parametric scripting, the design of the Phare Tower gathers disparate programmatic, physical, and infrastructural elements from the
	requirements of the building and its surrounding context, and synthesizes these into a form that seamlessly integrates the building into the idiosyncrasies
	of its site while expressing multiple flows of movement. In the spirit of the Paris Exposition competition proposals, the tower embodies state-of-the-art
	technological advances to become a cultural landmark.

	Kandinsky writes that the use of line in nature is an exceedingly frequent one. He observes that it is especially important for the artist to see how
	nature uses the basic elements in her independent realm. What characteristics these basic elements possess and in which manner they combine to form
	structures. Examination of structures in nature can help to understand composition and formation but not to superficially imitate it.
</p>
<p>
	Kandinsky observes that the line appears in nature in countless phenomena: in the minerals, plants and animal world. He shows the schematic construction of
	the crystal, that is purely linear formation.

	A plant in its entire development from seed to root as far as the beginning of the bud passes over from point to line. As it progresses it forms more

	branches always emanates from the same basic principle but exhibits the most varied arrangements. Kandinsky writes that both geometric constructions and
	more free line constructions can be found in the nature and in abstract painting.

	<a name="_Toc405541159">Plane</a>
</h2>
<h3>
	<a name="_Toc405541160">Graphical concept of the plane</a>
</h3>
<p>
	The mathematical concept of the plane is as Aristotle describes "a line by its motion produces a surface". This concept is close to Kandinsky's decryption
	of the plane. The plane is planar shape or a form with closed boundaries. The material plane of the graphic surface becomes the finite graphic context that
	has closed linear boundaries and is approached as a shape of the composition.
</p>
<p>
	The most sable and at the same time the most unstable plane is the circle. Kandinsky explains that curved line carries within it a seed of the plane. If
	the two forces, with conditions unchanged, roll the point ever further, the developing curve will arrive again at its starting point.
</p>
<p>
	There is another possibility to form a plane. If the straight lines are move about the common meeting point, finally they flow into one another. In this
	way a new form appears - a plane in the shape of a circle.
</p>
<p>
	There are many ways to create a plane. Their characteristics depend on the type of line they were created from. Kandinsky gives one example of primary
	contrasting pair of planes. Curved line needs two forces to create a plane in a contrast straight line needs three forces in plane creation.
</p>
<p>
	When the basic elements are manipulated on the plane, the graphic context can be seen as a basic plane. Kandinsky observes that pairs of linear segments
	usually bound this context. The basic plane is a material plane that receives the content of the work of art.
</p>
<p>
	According to Kandinsky the plane is a living being. He explains that when the basic plane receives the right elements in a right order this primitive
	living organism is transformed into a new living organism. It becomes no longer primitive but reveals all the characteristics of a fully developed
	organism. Further Kandinsky explains how the viewer should look at a basic plane. The right side of the basic plane should be the one which is opposite
	viewers left side and vice versa - as in the case of every other living thing.
</p>
<h3>
	<a name="_Toc405541161">Texture</a>
</h3>
<p>
	Kandinsky defines two possibilities of a texture concerning the plane. Material plane is created in a pure material way and is dependent upon the nature of
	this creation. Therefore textural possibilities can be as such: smooth, rough, prickly, glossy, dull and plastic. On the material plane the elements lying
	firmly (materially) on a solid, hard, to the eye, tangible plane.
</p>
<p>
	In a contrast to material plane Kandinsky describes dematerialized plane. There the elements are floating without material weight in an indefinable space.
	The purpose of this dematerialization in combination with the element according Kandinsky is the road from external to the inner.

	With this software, multiple machines, networked via the Internet, can communicate together, working at once in the same dynamic canvas. This represents an
